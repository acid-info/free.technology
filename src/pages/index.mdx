    <Mission title="Mission">
        ## We support the development, adoption, and accessibility of solutions to digital age problems and are guided by our principles: liberty, censorship resistance, security, privacy, and inclusivity.

        <div>
            <p>We seek to connect with and support those innovating to defend our digital rights. The IFT emerged from Status, which Jarrad Hope and Carl Bennetts founded to enable the free flow of information and protect the right to private, secure conversations in 2017.</p>
            <p>Over time, gaps in the infrastructure required to deliver Status in a form that fully reflects its founders’, contributors’, and users’ values became apparent, and the project’s scope widened. The IFT and the startups it incubates are the product of this expanded scope.</p>
